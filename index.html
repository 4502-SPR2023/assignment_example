      <p>Final Assignment! </p>

      <div class="description user_content teacher-version enhanced"><p><span>The final draft of your site should incorporate all the feedback you've gotten up to this point and should be publication-ready. </span></p>
<p>Your site will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>One home or landing page (index.html)</li>
<li>Three additional pages&nbsp;</li>
<li>A specific color palette and set of type faces</li>
<li>One CSS file for all pages</li>
</ul>
<h3>Due date</h3>
<p>8 p.m. on May 5.</p>
<h3>What should you build?</h3>
<p>This is the final version of your project, so it should include all the types of pages you'll need to have on your final site (one example of each unique page is fine). This is meant to be a complete product (immediately publishable). Your typecolor and other design elements should be final. Interactive elements should be working, and the site should work well both on mobile and on desktop views. There should be only one external stylesheet (see Will for exceptions). <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>For your JavaScript file(s) for your pages, it might make sense to have separate files for each page, because otherwise, you might have JavaScript errors if the code is looking for an element on that page that isn't on that page, but on another page.</em></strong></span></p>
<h3><a id="user-content-what-to-turn-in" class="anchor external" href="https://github.com/j4502-fs18/class/wiki/Final-Project#what-to-turn-in" target="_blank" aria-hidden="true"></a></h3>
<h3>What to turn in</h3>
<p>Your one-page statement with a link to your finished site, published on Github Pages, at the top. 400-600 words</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All positioning and styling are to be done in one external css file, not in the html. Tables should be used only if you have an actual table, not for layout. Make sure every page has a title that would help the user understand the purpose and content of that page. The title should not the same for each page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other than your home/landing page — which will be called index.html — the other HTML page files should have names that indicate the theme or content of that page in a way that would be helpful for users, whether they are sighted or using screen readers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include a one-page statement about the decisions you made. If you decide to ignore some portion of your feedback from earlier drafts, defend that decision in your statement. Explain what story you're trying to tell, and how you're telling it through the design and organization of your site. Be sure to include content-based reasons for your design decisions. NO MORE THAN 600 words. Be brief.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Grading:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Introduction page (10)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Text/Content (10)</strong>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Navigation (10)</strong> Is the navigation intuitive and consistent? Can I tell where I am, where I want to go, and where I've been? Do I as the user have control over how I work my way through the story, or do I have to go a certain way that can't be changed or varied?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design (40)</strong> Do you have a color palette that is used consistently and reflects the mood of the project? Did you establish typographic styles that are used consistently? Do you have typographic hierarchy that helps me figure out what purpose each piece of type serves? Is the type all legible? Does the site feel intentionally designed, with no default type or styles? Does the design enhance the content rather than distract from it? Do you have at least two alternative story formats?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Back End (15)</strong> Did you keep all styling, including positioning, out of the html? Did you use one external stylesheet for the whole site? Does every page have a title? Does your site render acceptably on various phone sizes? Do all of your CSS and HTML files validate?</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility and inclusivity (15)</strong> Do all images have alt tags that explain their content? Are there any images that use text that could have instead been rendered in HTML and CSS? Do video elements include caption services and/or transcripts? Do audio elements include transcripts? <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Do the colors have the right contrast?</span><span class="external_link_icon" style="margin-inline-start: 5px; display: inline-block; text-indent: initial; " role="presentation"><svg viewBox="0 0 1920 1920" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="width:1em; height:1em; vertical-align:middle; fill:currentColor">
